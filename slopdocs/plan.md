# Implementation Plan: Browser/Worker Architecture Split

## Project Overview
Major refactoring to resolve architectural issues in the consolidated `apex-ls` package from commit f213dbb7. The package consolidated 5 separate packages but introduced type conflicts between browser and worker environments that prevent clean compilation.

## Critical Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. Crypto Polyfill Type Conflicts 
- **Problem**: ArrayBufferLike vs ArrayBuffer incompatibility between DOM and WebWorker libs
- **Solution**: Split tsconfig approach with environment-specific TypeScript configurations
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
  - ✅ Created `tsconfig.browser.json` with DOM lib
  - ✅ Created `tsconfig.worker.json` with WebWorker lib  
  - ✅ Crypto polyfill compiles cleanly in both environments
  - ✅ Browser build compiles successfully

### 2. Build System Issues
- **Problem**: TypeScript errors bypassed, tsup bundling without type checking
- **Solution**: Added proper build pipeline with TypeScript compilation before bundling
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
  - ✅ Added `build` script: `npm run compile && npm run bundle`
  - ✅ Split compilation: `compile:browser` and `compile:worker`
  - ✅ Type errors now block builds as expected

### 3. Code Quality Issues
- **Problem**: Code duplication, dead code, over-engineering in logging systems
- **Solution**: Consolidated and simplified implementations
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
  - ✅ Created shared `LoggingUtils` to eliminate duplication
  - ✅ Removed dead postMessage functionality
  - ✅ Simplified singleton patterns

## Current Critical Issue 🚨

### Browser/Worker Architecture Conflicts
**Problem**: Unified architecture mixes browser and worker code causing compilation failures

**Root Cause**: Files reference both browser globals (`window`, `document`) and worker globals (`DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope`, `importScripts`) in the same codebase, making it impossible to compile for specific environments.

**Impact**: Worker build fails completely, preventing deployment in web worker contexts.

## Architectural Solution Strategy

### 📋 **Decisions Made**
1. **Code Organization**: Interface-based approach with abstract interfaces and platform-specific implementations
2. **Entry Points**: Split approach - create `browser.ts`, `worker.ts`, `index.ts` (types only)
3. **Communication Layer**: Split MessageBridge into BrowserMessageBridge and WorkerMessageBridge  
4. **Connection Management**: Separate factories for each environment
5. **Storage Layer**: Abstract storage interface with concrete implementations

### 🎯 **Implementation Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Platform-Specific Communication Layer** (✅ COMPLETED)
Create separate browser and worker implementations for communication components.

- ✅ Implemented proper TransportMessageHandlers for enhanced error handling

**✅ All Phase 1 Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Browser build compiles without errors
- ✅ Worker build compiles without errors  
- ✅ All message bridge functionality preserved

**Planned Tasks:**
- Create `browser.ts` entry point with browser-only exports
- Create `worker.ts` entry point with worker-only exports  
- Update `index.ts` to export only shared types
- Update build configuration for new entry points
- Migrate consumers to appropriate entry points
