# Consolidated Web Worker Architecture Action Plan

Based on both documents, here's a unified plan combining the refactoring needs with the web worker environment fixes.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues:

1. **Web Worker Environment**: VSCode web extension environment has corrupted worker execution - workers load but scripts never execute
2. **Dependency Compatibility**: Node.js dependencies causing bundle incompatibility with web environment
3. **Missing Functionality**: Document symbol generation failing due to removed/incompatible apex-parser dependency
4. **Architecture Gaps**: Web worker implementation incomplete with insufficient polyfills

### Detailed Problem Analysis

#### Core Issue
The VSCode web extension environment has a fundamental problem with ES module web worker execution. Workers are created successfully but their scripts never execute, causing language server functionality to fail completely.

#### Symptoms Observed
1. **Worker Creation Success**: `new Worker(url, {type: 'module'})` succeeds without errors
2. **Script Non-Execution**: Worker scripts load (200 OK responses) but never execute their code
3. **Silent Failure**: No error messages indicate why workers fail to run
4. **VSCode Internal Worker Errors**: Console shows `importScripts` errors from VSCode's own workers, indicating broader environment issues
5. **Timeout Behavior**: Workers never respond to messages, triggering 5-second timeouts

#### Root Cause Analysis
The issue stems from VSCode's web extension host environment having corrupted or misconfigured worker execution context. This affects:
- ES module worker script execution
- Worker script parsing/compilation
- Worker message passing initialization
- Internal VSCode worker infrastructure

## Consolidated Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization (HIGH Priority)

#### 1.1 Implement Robust Worker Factory

- **Location**: `packages/apex-lsp-vscode-extension-web/src/utils/worker-factory.ts`
- **Approach**: Multi-strategy worker creation with fallbacks:
  - Blob URL worker (already implemented)
  - Data URL worker
  - Inline worker creation
  - Classic worker fallback
- **Goal**: Bypass VSCode's broken ES module worker execution

**Enhanced Implementation**:
```typescript
export class RobustWorkerFactory {
  private static strategies = [
    'blob-url',
    'data-url',
    'direct-url',
    'classic-worker',
    'inline-worker'
  ];

  static async createWorker(options: WorkerOptions): Promise<Worker> {
    for (const strategy of this.strategies) {
      try {
        const worker = await this.tryStrategy(strategy, options);
        if (await this.validateWorker(worker)) {
          return worker;
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.warn(`Strategy ${strategy} failed:`, error);
      }
    }
    throw new Error('All worker creation strategies failed');
  }

  private static async validateWorker(worker: Worker): Promise<boolean> {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      const timeout = setTimeout(() => resolve(false), 2000);
      worker.onmessage = () => {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        resolve(true);
      };
      worker.postMessage({ type: 'health-check' });
    });
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 Fallback Worker Strategies

If blob approach fails, implement these alternatives:

**Option A: Inline Worker Creation**
```typescript
// Create worker from inline string content
const workerCode = `
  // Inline worker implementation
  console.log('[INLINE-WORKER] Starting...');
  // ... worker logic here
`;
const blob = new Blob([workerCode], { type: 'application/javascript' });
const worker = new Worker(URL.createObjectURL(blob), { type: 'module' });
```

**Option B: Data URL Worker**
```typescript
// Create worker from data URL
const workerContent = await fetch(workerUrl).then(r => r.text());
const dataUrl = `data:application/javascript,${encodeURIComponent(workerContent)}`;
const worker = new Worker(dataUrl, { type: 'module' });
```

**Option C: Classic Worker Fallback**
```typescript
// Convert ES modules to classic worker format
const worker = new Worker(workerUrl, { type: 'classic' }); // Remove 'module' type
```

#### 1.3 Restore Missing Dependencies

- **Critical**: Restore apex-parser with web-compatible bundling
- **Required**: Ensure antlr4ts works in web worker context
- **Polyfills Needed**:
  - File system operations (fs → VSCode workspace API)
  - Process/path utilities → web-compatible alternatives
  - Node.js Buffer → browser Buffer polyfill

### Phase 2: VSCode Environment Diagnosis (HIGH Priority)

#### 2.1 Environment Analysis Tasks

**2.1.1 Worker Context Investigation**

Files to examine:
- VSCode source: `src/vs/workbench/services/extensions/browser/webWorkerExtensionHost.ts`
- Extension host: `src/vs/workbench/api/browser/mainThreadWebview.ts`
- Worker bootstrap: `src/vs/base/browser/worker/simpleWorker.ts`

Investigation steps:
1. Check worker creation parameters in VSCode's extension host
2. Verify worker script loading mechanisms
3. Analyze worker message passing setup
4. Identify any worker environment isolation issues

**2.1.2 Module Resolution Analysis**

Key areas to investigate:
- ES module import resolution in worker context
- Worker script CSP (Content Security Policy) restrictions
- Worker URL resolution and base URL handling
- Module loading sandbox restrictions

**2.1.3 Console Error Pattern Analysis**

Current errors observed:
```
Failed to execute 'importScripts' on 'WorkerGlobalScope': Module scripts don't support importScripts()
```

Analysis required:
- Identify which VSCode components are triggering these errors
- Determine if errors are affecting our worker execution
- Check for error propagation that might be killing worker contexts

#### 2.2 Environment Configuration Fixes

**2.2.1 Worker Security Policy Updates**

Files to modify:
- VSCode's CSP headers for worker scripts
- Extension manifest security policies
- Worker script MIME type handling

Expected changes:
```typescript
// In VSCode's worker creation logic
const workerOptions = {
  type: 'module',
  credentials: 'same-origin',
  // Add proper CSP and security context
};
```

**2.2.2 Worker Bootstrap Enhancement**

Target: VSCode's worker initialization code
Goal: Ensure proper ES module worker support

Implementation:
```typescript
// Enhanced worker bootstrap with error handling
try {
  // Proper ES module worker initialization
  const worker = new Worker(scriptUrl, {
    type: 'module',
    name: workerName,
  });

  // Add comprehensive error handling
  worker.addEventListener('error', handleWorkerError);
  worker.addEventListener('messageerror', handleMessageError);

} catch (error) {
  console.error('Worker creation failed:', error);
  // Implement fallback strategies
}
```

#### 2.3 Document Symbol Generation Fix

- **Issue**: Document symbols not generating due to missing/broken apex-parser
- **Solution**:
  - Verify apex-parser is properly bundled in web worker
  - Ensure ANTLR grammar files are accessible
  - Fix any import/export compatibility issues

#### 2.4 Language Server Protocol Restoration

- **Focus**: Complete LSP message handling in web worker
- **Requirements**: All language features (symbols, completion, diagnostics)
- **Testing**: Verify outline view populates correctly

### Phase 3: Dependency Architecture Overhaul (MEDIUM Priority)

#### 3.1 Web-Compatible Bundling

- **Target**: `packages/apex-ls-browser/tsup.config.ts`
- **Strategy**:
  - Bundle all dependencies as web-compatible modules
  - Implement proper polyfills for Node.js APIs
  - Ensure worker script is self-contained

#### 3.2 Environment Polyfills

- **File System**: Use VSCode workspace API instead of Node.js fs
- **Process**: Replace with web-compatible process polyfill
- **Path**: Use browser-compatible path utilities
- **Crypto**: Use WebCrypto API instead of Node.js crypto

#### 3.3 Error Recovery and Monitoring

Implement:
- Automatic worker restart on failure
- Worker health monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Error reporting to extension telemetry

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (HIGH Priority)

#### 4.1 Functionality Tests

- Worker creation and execution
- Document symbol generation
- LSP message passing
- All language server features

#### 4.2 Cross-Environment Testing

- VS Code web (chrome, firefox, edge)
- Different VSCode versions
- Performance under load

#### 4.3 Worker Environment Testing Suite

Create comprehensive tests for:
- ES module worker creation and execution
- Worker message passing reliability
- Worker error handling and recovery
- Performance under load

### Phase 5: Long-term Environment Hardening (MEDIUM Priority)

#### 5.1 Worker Factory Abstraction

Location: `packages/apex-lsp-vscode-extension-web/src/utils/worker-factory.ts`

#### 5.2 Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

**5.2.1 Issue Documentation**

Create comprehensive documentation covering:
- Root cause analysis findings
- Solution implementation details
- Testing procedures and validation
- Troubleshooting guide for similar issues

**5.2.2 Code Comments and Architecture Notes**

Add detailed comments to:
- Worker creation logic explaining why blob URLs are needed
- Error handling rationale
- Fallback strategy selection criteria
- Performance considerations

## Implementation Order

1. Start with worker factory enhancement (addresses immediate worker execution failure)
2. Restore apex-parser dependency (fixes document symbols)
3. Implement missing polyfills (ensures web compatibility)
4. Test end-to-end functionality (validates complete solution)
