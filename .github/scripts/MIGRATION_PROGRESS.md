# Migration Progress: Bash to Node.js Scripts

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of bash scripts in GitHub workflows to TypeScript Node.js scripts for better maintainability, type safety, and reusability.

## Completed Migrations ‚úÖ

### Extension Release Workflow (`release-extensions.yml`)

- ‚úÖ **ext-build-type**: Determine build type (nightly, promotion, regular)
- ‚úÖ **ext-promotion-finder**: Find promotion commits and determine promotion status
- ‚úÖ **ext-change-detector**: Detect changes in extensions and determine version bumps
- ‚úÖ **ext-release-plan**: Display release plan for extensions
- ‚úÖ **ext-version-bumper**: Bump versions for selected extensions
- ‚úÖ **ext-publish-matrix**: Determine publish matrix for extensions
- ‚úÖ **ext-github-releases**: Create GitHub releases for extensions

### NPM Release Workflow (`release-npm.yml`)

- ‚úÖ **npm-change-detector**: Detect changes in NPM packages
- ‚úÖ **npm-package-selector**: Select packages for release
- ‚úÖ **npm-release-plan**: Display release plan for NPM packages
- ‚úÖ **npm-package-details**: Extract package details for notifications

### Main Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

- ‚úÖ **npm-package-selector**: Select packages for release (reused from NPM workflow)

### Slack Notifications

### Audit Logging

- ‚úÖ **audit-logger**: Log audit events for release operations

## In Progress üîÑ

### Workflow Integration

- üîÑ **Slack notification integration**: Replace bash-based Slack notifications with Node.js scripts
- üîÑ **Audit logging integration**: Add audit logging to release workflows

## Remaining Work üìã

### Version Bumping

- ‚è≥ **npm-version-bumper**: Bump versions for NPM packages (similar to ext-version-bumper)

### GitHub Release Creation

- ‚è≥ **npm-github-releases**: Create GitHub releases for NPM packages (if needed)

### Additional Utilities

- ‚è≥ **workflow-utils**: Common utilities for workflow operations
- ‚è≥ **validation-utils**: Input validation and sanitization utilities

## Benefits of Migration

### Type Safety

- All scripts are written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Compile-time error checking prevents runtime issues
- Better IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring

### Maintainability

- Modular design with reusable components
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Clear separation of concerns

### Reusability

- Scripts can be used across multiple workflows
- Common utilities shared between extension and NPM workflows
- Easy to test and debug individual components

### Error Handling

- Structured error messages with proper exit codes
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful failure handling

## Script Architecture

### Core Scripts

- **CLI Interface**: All scripts use Commander.js for consistent CLI interface
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with different levels (info, warn, error)
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with proper exit codes
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with interfaces and types

### Extension Scripts (ext-\*)

- Handle VS Code extension-specific logic
- Manage VSIX file patterns and marketplace publishing
- Support nightly builds and promotions
- Handle GitHub release creation

### NPM Scripts (npm-\*)

- Handle NPM package-specific logic
- Manage package.json versioning
- Support semantic versioning
- Handle NPM registry publishing

### Utility Scripts

- **audit-logger**: Log audit events for compliance
- **utils**: Common utilities and helpers

## Testing

### Manual Testing

- All scripts can be run manually with `npx tsx .github/scripts/index.ts <command>`
- Dry-run mode available for safe testing
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Integration Testing

- Scripts integrated into workflows for end-to-end testing
- Error scenarios tested with invalid inputs
- Cross-platform compatibility verified

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Scripts ‚úÖ

- Implemented basic change detection and package selection
- Created version bumping and release planning
- Added GitHub release creation

### Phase 2: Workflow Integration ‚úÖ

- Updated workflows to use Node.js scripts
- Replaced bash steps with script calls
- Maintained backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Advanced Features üîÑ

- Adding audit logging and Slack notifications
- Implementing additional utilities
- Optimizing performance and error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Slack integration**: Replace remaining bash-based Slack notifications
2. **Add audit logging**: Integrate audit logging into all release workflows
3. **Create NPM version bumper**: Implement version bumping for NPM packages
4. **Add validation utilities**: Create input validation and sanitization utilities
5. **Performance optimization**: Optimize script performance for large repositories
6. **Documentation**: Update documentation with new script usage examples

## Notes

- All scripts follow consistent naming conventions (ext-_ for extensions, npm-_ for NPM packages)
- Scripts are designed to be idempotent and safe to run multiple times
- Dry-run mode available for all destructive operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout
- TypeScript strict mode enabled for maximum type safety
