Apex has no import statements—never generate or expect them. The compiler resolves types by searching the current namespace, then the global namespace, then other installed namespaces. Fully qualified names (<namespace>.<TypeName>) are used only when a name conflict exists; otherwise, use the unqualified name. A namespace and a type in that namespace can share the same name (e.g., Acme.Acme) and this is valid. Namespace is determined by org/package metadata, not declared in code, and all Apex types and sObjects in the org are known to the compiler without imports.
