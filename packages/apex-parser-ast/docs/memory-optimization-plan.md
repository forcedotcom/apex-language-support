# Memory Optimization Plan for Symbol Storage

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to reduce memory usage in the Apex symbol storage system by approximately **80%** while maintaining or improving performance. The optimization targets the `ApexSymbolManager` and related components that currently consume excessive memory due to multiple cache layers, heavy object structures, and storage duplication.

**Key Innovation**: Integration of a custom `defineEnum` utility that provides memory-efficient, type-safe enum alternatives to traditional string enums.

## Current State Analysis

### Memory Consumption Issues

#### 1. Multiple Cache Layers (High Impact - 70MB waste for 10K symbols)

- **7 different HashMap caches** with 10,000 entry limits each
- Cache types: `symbolCache`, `relationshipCache`, `metricsCache`, `lazyMetrics`, `lazyAnalysis`, `symbolLookupCache`, `fqnLookupCache`, `fileLookupCache`, `relationshipTypeCache`, `patternMatchCache`, `statsCache`, `analysisCache`
- **Estimated memory waste**: ~70MB for 10K symbols (7 caches Ã— 10K entries Ã— 1KB each)

#### 2. Heavy Symbol Objects (Medium Impact - 40MB waste)

- Large `ApexSymbol` interfaces with optional fields
- Duplicate storage of scope hierarchy information
- Inefficient modifier storage (objects vs bit flags)
- **Estimated memory waste**: ~40MB for 10K symbols

#### 3. Graph Storage Overhead (Medium Impact - 30MB waste)

- Graphology graph storing full symbol objects
- Duplicate relationship data in multiple structures
- Inefficient edge storage for large symbol sets
- **Estimated memory waste**: ~30MB for 10K symbols

#### 4. String Enum Inefficiency (Low Impact - 15MB waste)

- Traditional string enums consuming 8-16 bytes per enum value
- No bidirectional mapping without additional storage
- **Estimated memory waste**: ~15MB for 10K symbols

**Total Estimated Waste**: ~155MB for 10K symbols
