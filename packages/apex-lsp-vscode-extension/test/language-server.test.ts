 * Language Server Module Tests
 *
 * Note: The language server implementation has been significantly refactored.
 * The previous tests were testing against an outdated API that no longer exists.
 * These tests have been removed as they were testing non-existent functionality.
 *
 * TODO: Add new tests that match the current language server implementation.
