# LSP Compliant Services Fix Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to fix the test failures in the lsp-compliant-services package caused by the extensive refactor. The issues are categorized by priority and impact.

## Issues Summary

### Critical Issues (Blocking Tests)

1. **FQN Construction Failure** - Hover shows incomplete names (e.g., `createFile` instead of `FileUtilities.createFile`)
2. **Symbol Resolution at Positions** - Wrong symbols found at specific positions
3. **Cross-File Symbol Resolution** - Cannot resolve symbols across different files

### High Priority Issues

4. **Context-Aware Symbol Resolution** - Static vs instance, inheritance context not working
5. **Integration Test Failures** - Multiple test suites failing

## Detailed Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Fix FQN Construction (Critical - 2-3 hours)

**Problem**: FQNs are not being constructed correctly, causing hover information to show incomplete names.

**Root Cause**: The `constructFQN` method in the symbol manager is not properly building hierarchical FQNs, and the fallback logic in `createHoverInformation` is not working correctly.

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `createHoverInformation` method
- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `findSymbolsAtPosition` method

**Fix Strategy**:

1. Enhance FQN construction in `createHoverInformation` method
2. Improve fallback logic for class detection
3. Add better namespace handling
4. Ensure proper symbol manager integration

**Test Cases to Fix**:

- `should provide hover information for createFile method` - expects `**FQN:** FileUtilities.createFile`
- `should provide hover information for test method createFileSucceedsWhenCorrectInput` - expects `**FQN:** FileUtilitiesTest.createFileSucceedsWhenCorrectInput`

### Phase 2: Fix Position-Based Symbol Resolution (Critical - 3-4 hours)

**Problem**: Hover service is finding wrong symbols at specific positions, causing incorrect hover information.

**Root Cause**: Position-based symbol lookup logic has issues with coordinate systems (0-indexed vs 1-indexed) and symbol location data.

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `findSymbolsAtPosition` method
- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `resolveBestSymbol` method

**Fix Strategy**:

1. Fix coordinate system issues (0-indexed vs 1-indexed)
2. Verify symbol location data is correct
3. Add comprehensive position validation
4. Improve symbol filtering and ranking

**Test Cases to Fix**:

- `should provide hover information when referencing FileUtilities from test class` - expects `**Class** FileUtilities`
- `should provide hover information for method calls` - expects `**Method** createFile`

### Phase 2.5: Integrate TypeReference System (NEW - 1-2 hours)

**Problem**: The new `TypeReference` system provides precise AST-based position data and relationship tracking that can significantly improve symbol resolution accuracy.

**Root Cause**: Current implementation relies on text extraction instead of using the rich relationship data captured during parsing.

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `findSymbolsAtPosition` method
- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `findCrossFileSymbols` method
- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `resolveBestSymbol` method

**Fix Strategy**:

1. **Update Position-Based Resolution** to use `TypeReference` data:

   ```typescript
   // Instead of text extraction, use stored references
   private findSymbolsAtPosition(document: TextDocument, position: any): any[] {
     // Use symbolManager.findReferencesAtPosition() if available
     // Fall back to current logic for backward compatibility
   }
   ```

2. **Enhance Symbol Manager Integration**:

   ```typescript
   // Add method to find references at specific positions
   findReferencesAtPosition(filePath: string, position: Position): TypeReference[]
   ```

3. **Update Cross-File Resolution** to use relationship data:
   ```typescript
   // Use relationship tracking instead of name-based search
   findRelatedSymbols(symbol: ApexSymbol, ReferenceType.METHOD_CALL)
   ```

**Benefits**:

- **More Accurate Position Detection**: Exact AST-based positions instead of text parsing
- **Better Context Understanding**: Rich relationship data for disambiguation
- **Improved Performance**: Pre-computed relationships instead of runtime analysis
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Clear relationship chains for troubleshooting

### Phase 3: Fix Cross-File Symbol Resolution (High Priority - 1-2 hours)

**Problem**: Hover service cannot resolve symbols across different files, causing cross-class references to fail.

**Root Cause**: Cross-file symbol resolution logic is not properly integrated or working.

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `findCrossFileSymbols` method
- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `extractSymbolNamesFromLine` method

**Fix Strategy**:

1. Fix `findCrossFileSymbols` method using enhanced relationship data
2. Improve symbol name extraction from text
3. Add better cross-file symbol ranking
4. Fix import statement handling

### Phase 4: Fix Context-Aware Symbol Resolution (Medium Priority - 1-2 hours)

**Problem**: Context analysis (static vs instance, inheritance, etc.) is not working properly.

**Root Cause**: Context analysis methods are not properly integrated with symbol resolution.

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `analyzeApexContext` method
- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - `filterSymbolsByContext` method

**Fix Strategy**:

1. Fix static vs instance context detection using `ReferenceType.STATIC_ACCESS` vs `ReferenceType.INSTANCE_ACCESS`
2. Improve inheritance chain analysis using `ReferenceType.INHERITANCE`
3. Enhance type context resolution using `ReferenceType.TYPE_REFERENCE`
4. Fix symbol ranking based on context

**Test Cases to Fix**:

- `should resolve static method when in static context` - expects `**Method** getStaticValue`
- `should resolve instance method when in instance context` - expects `**Method** getValue`
- `should resolve symbol based on expected type context` - expects `**Method** getValue`
- `should resolve symbol based on inheritance context` - expects `**Extends:** BaseClass`

### Phase 5: Test Infrastructure and Debugging (Medium Priority - 1 hour)

**Problem**: Need better debugging and test infrastructure to prevent future regressions.

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/services/HoverProcessingService.ts` - Add comprehensive logging
- `test/integration/HoverRealClasses.integration.test.ts` - Improve test debugging

**Fix Strategy**:

1. Add comprehensive logging throughout hover service
2. Enhance debug logging in symbol resolution
3. Add symbol resolution tracing
4. Improve error reporting
