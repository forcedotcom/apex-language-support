# Compile

`npm run compile` will re-compile all the packages.

`npm run compile -w <path to package>` to compile a single package (can be useful, but it must pass at the repo level to consider compile step complete)

## TS4023 Errors

If you encounter TS4023 errors when compiling, see `@.claude/skills/ts4023-effect-errors/` for how to fix them.
