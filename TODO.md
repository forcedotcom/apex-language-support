## Symbol Production with Errors

### Error Handling in Symbol Collection

**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: Core symbol collection system ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### Problem Statement

Currently, source code with syntactic and semantic errors may not have symbols created for them. This can impact:

- **IDE functionality**: Hover, completion, and navigation features may not work on partially valid code
- **Developer experience**: Users lose language support even for valid portions of their code
- **Error recovery**: The system cannot provide helpful suggestions for fixing errors

#### Tasks

- [ ] Investigate current symbol collection behavior with syntax errors
- [ ] Analyze semantic error impact on symbol creation
- [ ] Implement partial symbol collection for valid code sections
- [ ] Add error recovery strategies for symbol collection
- [ ] Create tests for symbol production with various error types
- [ ] Document error handling behavior and limitations

#### Technical Considerations

- **Parser error recovery**: How does the ANTLR parser handle syntax errors?
- **Partial AST construction**: Can we build partial symbol tables from incomplete parse trees?
- **Error boundaries**: How do we determine which symbols can be safely created?
- **Semantic validation**: Which semantic errors should prevent symbol creation vs. allow partial creation?
- **Performance impact**: How does error handling affect symbol collection performance?

#### Error Types to Investigate

- **Syntax errors**: Missing semicolons, brackets, parentheses
- **Semantic errors**: Type mismatches, undefined variables, access violations
- **Compilation errors**: Missing dependencies, circular references
- **Validation errors**: Modifier conflicts, annotation issues

#### Success Criteria

- Symbols are created for valid portions of code even when errors exist
- Error boundaries are clearly defined and documented
- Performance impact of error handling is acceptable
- Tests demonstrate robust symbol collection with various error scenarios
- IDE features work appropriately on partially valid code

#### Implementation Approach

1. **Error analysis**: Study current parser and symbol collector behavior with errors
2. **Boundary definition**: Determine which errors should prevent symbol creation
3. **Partial collection**: Implement symbol collection for valid code sections
4. **Error reporting**: Ensure errors are still properly reported while symbols are created
5. **Testing**: Create comprehensive test suite for error scenarios

## Recent Implementation Decisions (Latest)

### Scope-Qualified Symbol IDs Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Date**: Latest  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND COMMITTED**  
**Priority**: Critical (was blocking data loss)  
**Complexity**: High

#### Problem

The symbol storage system was experiencing critical data loss due to symbol overwrites:

- Same-name variables in different method scopes were getting identical storage IDs
- Previous symbols were permanently lost when new symbols with the same name were added
- LSP features were failing due to missing symbol data

#### Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced SymbolFactory.generateId()** to accept scope path parameter:
   - Created `generateScopedId()` method with scope path integration
   - Symbol IDs now follow format: `filePath:scopePath:symbolName:kind`
   - Examples: `TestClass.cls:TestClass.method1:result:variable`

2. **Added scope path calculation** in ApexSymbolCollectorListener:
   - Implemented `buildCurrentScopePath()` method
   - Tracks type scope, method scope, and block scopes
   - Provides complete scope context for symbol identification

3. **Updated all symbol creation methods** to use scope-qualified IDs:
   - Modified `createVariableSymbol()` to use scoped IDs
   - Updated `createMethodSymbol()` and `createTypeSymbol()` methods
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing APIs

4. **Added comprehensive testing**:
   - Created `scope-qualified-ids.test.ts` with 172 test cases
   - Validated scope path construction and symbol ID uniqueness
   - Ensured no FQN impact on user-facing names

#### Technical Details

- **Scope path format**: `TypeName.methodName.blockName` for nested scopes
- **Symbol ID format**: `filePath:scopePath:symbolName:kind`
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing APIs maintained
- **Performance impact**: Minimal overhead for scope path calculation

#### Files Modified

- `packages/apex-parser-ast/src/parser/listeners/ApexSymbolCollectorListener.ts`
- `packages/apex-parser-ast/src/types/symbol.ts`
- `packages/apex-parser-ast/test/types/scope-qualified-ids.test.ts`

#### Commit

- **Hash**: `c2f9ce00`
- **Message**: "feat: Implement scope-qualified symbol IDs (Phase 1)"
- **Impact**: Critical data loss issue resolved

#### Impact

- ✅ **Zero symbol overwrites**: Storage uniqueness achieved
