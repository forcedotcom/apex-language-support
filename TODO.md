# TODO: Future Work and Enhancements

## Overview

This document captures future work and enhancements identified during the position-based symbol lookup planning discussion. These items are deferred from the current implementation to focus on core functionality first.

## Phase 2: Cross-File Resolution (Near Term)

### Lazy Binding System

**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion

#### Tasks

- [ ] Implement `LazyReferenceResolver` class
- [ ] Add cross-file reference binding logic
- [ ] Implement resolution queue management
- [ ] Add access constraint validation
- [ ] Handle namespace conflicts and imports

#### Technical Details

- Cross-file references cannot be fully resolved until both sides are materialized
- Must validate access/visibility constraints before resolving references
- Need to handle built-in types (System, String, Integer, etc.)
- Qualified references like "FileUtilities.createFile" require special handling

#### Success Criteria

- Cross-file references resolve correctly
- Built-in types work properly
- Qualified references resolve correctly
- Performance data shows acceptable resolution times

## Phase 3: Real-Time Updates (Future)

### Change Detection and Graph Surgery

**Priority**: Low  
**Complexity**: High  
**Dependencies**: Phases 1-2 completion

#### Tasks

- [ ] Implement file change detection
- [ ] Add incremental graph update logic
- [ ] Handle symbol additions, deletions, and modifications
- [ ] Implement efficient ReferenceVertex updates
- [ ] Add batch update operations
- [ ] Handle reference invalidation and rebinding

#### Technical Challenges

**"Managing system state in real time without causing chaos in the data structures"**

- **Single line addition**: Minimal rebinding scope
- **Line deletion with reference**: Remove reference vertex
- **Symbol rename**: Update all related references
- **File deletion**: Clean up all related references
- **Symbol modification**: Rebind affected references

#### Implementation Considerations

- Must consider relative change scope for efficient graph updates
- Need sophisticated change detection to minimize unnecessary work
- Graph surgery operations must be atomic and consistent
- Performance impact of real-time updates must be minimal

#### Success Criteria

- File changes update graph without data structure corruption
- Update performance remains acceptable for large codebases
- No memory leaks from stale references
- Graph consistency maintained during concurrent operations

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Future)

### Memory Management

**Priority**: Low  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: Performance data from Phases 1-2

#### Tasks

- [ ] Implement ReferenceVertex cleanup strategies
- [ ] Add memory usage optimization
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Graph partitioning optimization
- [ ] Reference pooling implementation
- [ ] Performance tuning based on collected data

#### Performance Metrics to Collect

- Resolution time for same-file vs. cross-file references
- Memory overhead for different reference types
- Binding success rates
- Reference type distribution (same-file vs. cross-file ratios)
- Cache hit rates and eviction patterns

#### Optimization Strategies

- **Reference Vertex Pooling**: Reuse instances for similar references
- **Graph Partitioning**: Separate by file or namespace
- **Lazy Resolution Queue Management**: Prioritize and track resolution attempts
- **Memory Cleanup**: Remove unresolved references after timeout
- **Caching**: Cache resolved symbols to avoid repeated lookups
