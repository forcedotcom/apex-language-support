# ðŸš€ Quick Start Testing Guide

## âœ… Your Workflows Are Ready to Test!

Based on the validation results, your GitHub Actions workflows are properly configured and ready for testing.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps (In Order)

### 1. **Local Validation** âœ… COMPLETED

```bash
./scripts/test-workflows.sh
```

**Result**: All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰

### 2. **Test Individual Components**

Go to GitHub â†’ Actions â†’ "Test Workflows Locally"

Choose one of these test types:

- **package-detection**: Verify package discovery
- **change-detection**: Test change detection logic
- **artifact-creation**: Test VSIX creation
- **version-bumping**: Test version calculation
- **npm-publishing**: Test NPM package validation
- **extension-publishing**: Test extension validation

### 3. **Dry Run Release** ðŸ†•

Go to GitHub â†’ Actions â†’ "Release All"

**Enable Dry Run Mode:**

- Check the **"Run in dry-run mode"** checkbox
- Configure other inputs as needed
- **No actual publishing occurs** - just shows what would happen

This simulates a complete release without publishing:

- Shows which packages would be released
- Displays version calculations
- Lists target registries
- **No actual publishing occurs**

### 4. **Test CI Workflow**

Create a test PR or push to main to trigger:

- Multi-OS/Node testing
- VSIX package creation
- Coverage report generation

### 5. **Test Package Workflow**

Manually trigger the package workflow to test:

- VSIX file creation
- Artifact upload
- Naming conventions

### 6. **Test Release Workflows**

After dry run passes, test actual releases:

- Start with a single package
- Use a test branch
- Monitor execution closely

## ðŸ”§ Issues Found & Fixed

The validation found one minor issue:

- No issues found in current package structure

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Release Checklist

Before running actual releases:

- [x] Local validation passes
- [ ] Dry run workflow completes successfully
- [ ] All required secrets configured in GitHub
- [ ] Test on feature branch first
- [ ] Verify artifact downloads work
- [ ] Check registry authentication

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Testing

For urgent fixes:

1. Run `./scripts/test-workflows.sh` (quick validation)
2. Use dry-run mode in Release All workflow
3. Test on feature branch
4. Monitor workflow execution

## ðŸ“ž Next Steps

1. **Configure Secrets**: Set up NPM_TOKEN, VSCE_PAT, etc. in GitHub repository settings
2. **Test Dry Run**: Run the Release All workflow with dry-run enabled
3. **Start Small**: Test with a single package first
4. **Monitor**: Watch workflow execution and logs

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Indicators

Your workflows are working correctly when:

- âœ… Local validation script passes
- âœ… Dry run shows correct packages/versions
- âœ… CI workflow creates artifacts
- âœ… Package workflow uploads VSIX files
- âœ… Release workflows publish successfully

## ðŸ†• **New Integrated Dry-Run Feature**

Instead of a separate dry-run workflow, you now have:

- **Single workflow** for both dry-run and real releases
- **Checkbox option** to enable dry-run mode
- **Same logic** - no duplication
- **Easier maintenance** - one workflow to rule them all
